You can catch all events in window scope:

```js
window.addEventListener('LR_UPLOAD_START', (e) => {
  console.log(e.detail);
});
```

To define what exact workflow caused an event, use the context name:

```html
...
<lr-file-uploader-regular ctx-name="UPLOADER_1"></lr-file-uploader-regular>
...
<lr-file-uploader-regular ctx-name="UPLOADER_2"></lr-file-uploader-regular>
...
```

```js
window.addEventListener('LR_UPLOAD_START', (e) => {
  if (e.detail.ctx === 'UPLOADER_1') {
    console.log('Uploading started in the FIRST uploader instance.', e.detail.data);
  } else if (e.detail.ctx === 'UPLOADER_2') {
    console.log('Uploading started in the SECOND uploader instance.', e.detail.data);
  }
});
```
