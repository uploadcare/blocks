# Uploadcare SDK for JavaScript developers

## üíé Core concept

* All in one place: here you can find everything you need to build a modern and reliable web application with Uploadcare on board.
* Modern technologies: web components, service workers, wasm, and other cutting edge web standards are ready to show their power.
* Type safety with a JSDoc declaration and TypeScript static analysis.
* Modern ESM-level code sharing.
* Build stage is not necessary for development: use the code directly in any modern browser or Node.js.
* Fast and secure.
* Minimum of external dependencies: security audit is not expensive.
* We are trying to be close to the native web platform as possible and don't force you to use any specific development environment tools.
* Tested by Uploadcare community.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs in the box?

* [upload-blocks](./upload-blocks/) - build your own uploading flow with the simple HTML and CSS.
* Adaptive image delivery tools: all you need to distribute your web images efficiently.
* File uploading client library: handle files from browser or node.
* Web components for media content representation: audio, video, image galleries, etc.
* Cloud image editing tools: tune your pictures on-the-fly.
* Analytic tools: get your page score.
* Common purpose components and tools.
* etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and startup

1. Clone repository: `git clone git@github.com:uploadcare/jsdk.git ./`
2. Run dependencies setup: `npm run setup`
3. Start local dev-server: `npm run dev` 

**Or you can use any other local server at the project root**

All code in this repository works without any other build process in any modern browser. You can open any HTML file in the project structure to make it work during development or testing purposes. No source maps or rebuilds are needed.

Also, all content (except node_modules) is fully accessible at https://uploadcare.github.io/jsdk/ with the same folder structure.
