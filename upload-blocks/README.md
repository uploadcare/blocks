# &lt;upload-blocks&gt;

## üß© Build your own file uploading flow with the set of pre-defined custom elements!

> Or dive deeper and create your own beautiful blocks!

## üç∞ Concept description

There are so many use cases and many workflows for file uploading.
Is it possible to create an uploading solution to fit them all? 

We believe - yes, with a power of [Custom Elements standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) and our widget-purpose-specific open-source [Symbiote.js](https://github.com/symbiotejs/symbiote.js) library.

You can use high-level, simple HTML and CSS to customize layouts and define the most popular scenarios. 
You can create your own blocks from scratch with JavaScript using our super-duper [BlockComponent base-class](./docs/block-component.html).

Key features:

* Easy to use within any modern toolchain: framework, library, or CMS.
* Livecycle is controlled from the inside; you don't need to manage it in your code.
* You can easily switch between encapsulated secure styling and common document styles. 
* Using of [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) - is up to you
* Very easy to set any customized data context for the blocks, to control them in details.
* Total flexibility.
* No expensive for the bandwidth and performance libraries or other heavy dependencies are needed.
* If you have strict design guidelines, then this is not a problem anymore!
* Everything is very close to the native browser API's and concepts; you don't need to learn something completely new.
* [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) friendly - good for secure enterprise usage
* [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) friendly: enter the new world of web development!

## üè† Integration basics

We use [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) standard to make integration seamless. That allows us to use simple HTML code to define layouts and place our widgets into any other templates or markup. Custom Elements are compatible with most modern technologies and provide a consistent workflow for all of them. Please, check out the list of high-level tests passed with a set of modern frontend frameworks and libraries: [Custom Elements Everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/)

We also provide a set of [reference integrations](https://github.com/uploadcare/upload-blocks-examples).

To integrate the Uploadcare widget, first of all, you should connect our script:
```html
<script 
  src="../upload-blocks/DefaultWidget/DefaultWidget.js"
  type="module">
</script>
```

You can use `npm` to install upload-blocks into your project:
`npm install ...`

Basic integration HTML code example:
```html
<uc-default-widget
  css-src="../upload-blocks/themes/uc-basic/index.css">
</uc-default-widget>
```
As you can see, it's very simple.

> You should obtain a Public API Key in your [Uploadcare project's dashboard](https://app.uploadcare.com/) to use file uploading features. 

For demo-only purposes, you can use `demopublickey` instead:
```html
<uc-default-widget
  style="--pubkey:'demopublickey'; --darkmode: 1"
  css-src="../upload-blocks/themes/uc-basic/index.css">
</uc-default-widget>
```

Some of widget settings in this example are passed via CSS variables. That means you can use styles, CSS-classes and dedicated CSS-files to pass any setting to any block or redefine if using native DOM API or just native HTML syntax. Let's move forvard to the next section, to explain that.

## üé® Customize everything!

First of all, please look at [our CSS approach discussion](https://github.com/uploadcare/jsdk/discussions/18). 
Please don't be shy to participate; your opinion is very important for us.

### Basic configuration

All basic configurations for each block could be provided via the set of [CSS-variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties):
```css
.uc-wgt-cfg, .uc-wgt-common, :host {
  --ctx-name: 'my-uploader';
  --cfg-pubkey: 'demopublickey';
  --cfg-multiple: 1;
  --cfg-confirm-upload: 1;
  --cfg-img-only: 0;
  --cfg-accept: '';
  --cfg-store: 1;
  --cfg-camera-mirror: 1;
  --cfg-source-list: 'local, url, camera, dropbox, gdrive, facebook';
  --cfg-max-files: 10;
  --cfg-max-local-file-size-bytes: 30000;
  --cfg-thumb-size: 76;
  --cfg-show-empty-list: 0;
  --cfg-use-local-image-editor: 0;
  --cfg-use-cloud-image-editor: 0;
}
```

The variable value should be a correct JSON value. Strings should be taken in quotes. 
We use the `1` or `0` numbers to define boolean flags.

Any configuration value can be defined and redefined at any level of the DOM tree at any time.

### Look & feel

Each block has a reference CSS file, placed at the common directory with the JavaScript class definition module. You can use it as the template to create your own custom styling (or CSS-animations) for any library block. All blocks and their children act like regular DOM elements; in that case, you can use native CSS-selectors and any of the well-known styling approaches. All significant component states are provided as the element attribute flags, so you can use the full power of CSS to customize blocks in deep.

### Layout & composition

Block components can be used separately or in combinations. You can compose them into the common workflow:

```html
<uc-simple-btn></uc-simple-btn>

<uc-modal strokes>
  <uc-activity-icon slot="heading"></uc-activity-icon>
  <uc-activity-caption slot="heading"></uc-activity-caption>
  <uc-start-from>
    <uc-source-list wrap></uc-source-list>
    <uc-drop-area></uc-drop-area>
  </uc-start-from>
  <uc-upload-list></uc-upload-list>
  <uc-camera-source></uc-camera-source>
  <uc-url-source></uc-url-source>
  <uc-external-source></uc-external-source>
  <uc-upload-details></uc-upload-details>
  <uc-confirmation-dialog></uc-confirmation-dialog>
</uc-modal>

<uc-message-box></uc-message-box>
<uc-progress-bar></uc-progress-bar>
```

### Block templates

You can quickly redefine any block template by setting the new `template` property value to any block class. Here is an example:

```js
import { UC } from '@uploadcare/upload-blocks';

UC.ProgressBar.template = /*html*/ `
  <h1>My custom heading</h1>
  <div class="my-custom-class">
    My custom template
  </div>
`;
```

All elements created by upload-blocks are discoverable via developer tools in your browser, so its easy to find out what exactly you should edit to achieve proper result. You don't need to install any specific tool to do that.

### Custom blocks

You can create your own custom upload-blocks to handle some specific use cases. You need to use [BlockComponent](./docs/block-component/) JavaScript base class, to do that.

## üì§ Data output

We providing the dedicated block for the data output purposes - `<uc-data-output>`. 
This Custom Element can be connected to some workflow context and provide you with convenient data access.

Here is the code example:

```html
<uc-data-output
  console
  fire-events
  from="*dataOutput"
  item-template="<img src='https://ucarecdn.com/{{uuid}}/-/preview/' />">
<uc-data-output>
```
Let's walk through its attributes:

* `console` - this flag lets you enable browser console output without modifying the source code.
* `fire-events` - this flag enables custom events (`data-output`) dispatching for the DOM element. These events contain all uploading data and could be processed at any level of your application.
* `from` - data output could be connected to any field in the workflow context. You can specify the certain one. By default, it is a `*dataOutput`; you can skip this setting for the default uploading case.
* `item-template` - uploading results could be rendered as a list of nested DOM elements. You can specify a simple template for that.
* `form-value` - could be used to handle HTML-forms.
